## Zebra Crosswalks Recognition for Visually Impaired People

For visually impaired people (VIPs), crossing roads can be challenging.
Using a smartphone app, this project aims to assist VIPs by showing them their exact location relative to the crosswalk.
My contribution to the project was to develop the crosswalk recognition algorithm using python and OpenCV.
The algorithm tells the user where they are located relative to the crosswalk by text and voice.
